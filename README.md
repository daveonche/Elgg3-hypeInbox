## Usage / Configuration

The plugin allows you to define new types of communication between users. To configure new message types,
you can use recipient roles, sender roles and relationships between them

For example, if you would like to allow users to send 'homework' to their supervisors, you would use the following configuration:

 * Sender type: Any user
 * Recipient type: Supervisor
 * Relationship: Supervisor
 * Inverse relationship: yes
 * Group relationship: --blank--

If you would like to allow Editors to send 'notices' to Administrators, you would use the following:

 * Sender type: Editor
 * Recipient type: Administrator
 * Relationship: --blank--
 * Inverse relationship: --blank--
 * Group relationship: --blank--

If you would like to allow Group exchange between members of the same group, you would use the following:

 * Sender: Any user
 * Recipient: Any user
 * Relationship: --blank--
 * Inverse relationship: --blank--
 * Group relationship: member
